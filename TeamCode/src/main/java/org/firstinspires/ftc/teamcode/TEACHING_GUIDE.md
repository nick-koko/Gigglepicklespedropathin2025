# Teaching Guide for NextFTC Migration (Middle School)

## For Teachers: Quick Start

**Goal:** Migrate from RoadRunner Actions to NextFTC with **minimal confusion** for students.

**Strategy:** Keep TeleOp almost identical, improve autonomous with simple concepts.

---

## What Your Students Need to Know

### Core Message
"We're switching because the old way (RoadRunner Actions) had bugs with our path following library (Pedro Pathing). The new way (NextFTC) fixes those bugs AND makes autonomous easier!"

### Three New Concepts (That's It!)

1. **Subsystem** = Robot mechanism (like intake, claw, arm)
   - "It's just our old mechanism file with a new name"

2. **Sequential** = Do things one after another
   - Analogy: "Do homework, THEN play video games"

3. **Parallel** = Do things at the same time
   - Analogy: "Listen to music WHILE doing homework"

---

## Teaching Sequence (Recommended)

### Lesson 1: Convert One Mechanism (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Students understand that subsystems are just renamed mechanism files.

**Steps:**
1. Show `IntakeMotorSpinner.java` side-by-side with `IntakeSubsystem.java`
2. Point out the 5 changes (use `BEFORE_AND_AFTER.md`)
3. Do the conversion together as a class
4. Have each student convert one mechanism file

**Key Points:**
- "We're just renaming things"
- "The code inside is exactly the same"
- "It's the same motor, same controls, same everything"

**Success Check:** Students can explain that a subsystem is just a mechanism with a new name.

### Lesson 2: Update TeleOp (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Students see that TeleOp barely changes.

**Steps:**
1. Show old TeleOp side-by-side with new TeleOp
2. Point out the 4 tiny changes
3. Update TeleOp together as a class
4. Deploy and test - show it works the same!

**Key Points:**
- "We're changing 4 lines out of 50"
- "Everything works exactly the same"
- "Your gamepad controls are identical"

**Success Check:** Students can update TeleOp and it works first try.

### Lesson 3: Autonomous Concepts (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Students understand sequential vs parallel.

**Steps:**
1. **Don't show code yet!** Use analogies:
   - Sequential: Making a sandwich (bread, then peanut butter, then jelly)
   - Parallel: Doing homework while listening to music
2. Ask for more examples from them
3. Show `StudentFriendlyAutonomous.java` with heavy comments
4. Walk through it line by line, relating to analogies

**Key Points:**
- "Sequential = one step at a time"
- "Parallel = two things together"
- "We couldn't do parallel easily before!"

**Success Check:** Students can explain sequential vs parallel with their own examples.

### Lesson 4: Build Simple Autonomous (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Students write a working autonomous routine.

**Steps:**
1. Start with the simplest possible autonomous:
   ```java
   schedule(
       new SequentialGroup(
           new FollowPathCommand(follower, path),
           new WaitCommand(1.0)
       )
   );
   ```
2. Add one InstantCommand:
   ```java
   new InstantCommand(() -> intake.intake())
   ```
3. Make something parallel:
   ```java
   new ParallelGroup(
       new FollowPathCommand(follower, path),
       new InstantCommand(() -> intake.intake())
   )
   ```
4. Let students add more steps

**Key Points:**
- Build incrementally
- Test after each addition
- Use comments to explain each step

**Success Check:** Students can add a new sequential step and a parallel action on their own.

## Common Student Struggles & Solutions

### "What does () -> mean?"

**Student Friendly Explanation:**
"The `() ->` is like giving the robot instructions on a sticky note. We write:
```java
new InstantCommand(() -> intake.intake())
```

Think of it as: 'When you get to this step, read the sticky note that says intake.intake()'"

**Don't say:** "It's a lambda expression" or "functional programming"

### "Why do we need register()?"

**Student Friendly Explanation:**
"The `register()` line is like taking attendance. We're telling NextFTC 'Hey, we have an intake mechanism on our robot.' That way NextFTC knows what to manage."

**Don't say:** "It registers the subsystem with the command scheduler"

### "Why did we change Intake() to intake()?"

**Student Friendly Explanation:**
"In Java, there's a style guide. Methods (actions) should start with lowercase, Classes (things) should start with uppercase. We're just following the rules now."

**Optional:** "It's like grammar rules in English - capitals at the start of sentences."

### "I don't get ParallelGroup"

**Hands-On Activity:**
1. Ask student to pat head
2. Ask student to rub belly
3. Ask student to do both at once
4. "That's parallel! The robot can drive (pat head) while intaking (rub belly)!"

### "This seems harder than before"

**Response:**
"TeleOp is almost the same - just renamed things. Autonomous is different because the old way (RoadRunner Actions) didn't work. This new way actually makes autonomous EASIER because you can say 'drive while intaking' instead of complicated code."

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Students Forget to register()

**Error:** NullPointerException when trying to use subsystem

**Fix:** Add `register(subsystem)` in init

**Teaching Moment:** "It's like forgetting to take attendance - NextFTC doesn't know the subsystem exists!"

### Students Use Old Method Names

**Error:** `cannot find symbol: method Intake()`

**Fix:** Change `Intake()` to `intake()`

**Teaching Moment:** "Remember, we changed to lowercase! Check your BEFORE_AND_AFTER guide."

### Students Forget extends Subsystem

**Error:** Class doesn't compile

**Fix:** Add `extends Subsystem` to the class declaration

**Teaching Moment:** "Subsystem is like a template. We need to tell Java we're using that template."

### Autonomous Doesn't Run

**Error:** Nothing happens in autonomous

**Fix:** Make sure `schedule()` is in `start()`, not `init()`

**Teaching Moment:** "Commands go in start(), not init(). Init is for setup, start is for action!"

## Assessment Ideas

### Quick Check (After Lesson 1)
"Explain in one sentence: What is a subsystem?"
- Good answer: "A subsystem is a mechanism on the robot, like intake or claw"
- Great answer: "A subsystem is like our old mechanism file, just renamed"

### Quick Check (After Lesson 3)
"Give an example of sequential and parallel from everyday life."
- Good answer: "Sequential: getting dressed. Parallel: walking and talking."

### Hands-On Assessment
"Add a new step to the autonomous: After picking up, drive to a new location."
- Success: Student adds a SequentialGroup step
- Extension: "Now make the robot outtake while driving there"

## What NOT to Teach (Yet)

❌ **Don't mention:**
- Separate command files (use inline only)
- Button bindings (keep if statements)
- Complex command logic
- Advanced NextFTC features
- Lambda expressions (just call them "instructions on sticky notes")

✅ **Focus on:**
- Subsystems = mechanisms
- Sequential = steps
- Parallel = together
- InstantCommand = one action
- Basic autonomous patterns

---

## Parent/Admin Communication

**Email Template:**

"We're updating our robot code to fix compatibility issues with our path-following library. The changes are minimal for our day-to-day driving code (TeleOp), but make our autonomous programming much more reliable and easier to understand. Students will learn three new concepts (subsystems, sequential, and parallel commands) that are widely used in FTC robotics."

---

## Extension Activities (For Advanced Students)

### Challenge 1: Complex Autonomous
"Create an autonomous that:
1. Scores preload
2. Picks up 3 game elements (driving and intaking each time)
3. Scores all 3"

### Challenge 2: Conditional Logic
"Make the intake run only until a sensor detects a game element."
(This introduces SpinUpFlywheelCommand-style commands)

### Challenge 3: Multiple Mechanisms
"Add a claw subsystem and make autonomous open/close it at the right times."

## Success Metrics

**After migration, students should be able to:**
- [ ] Convert a mechanism file to a subsystem (5 minutes)
- [ ] Update TeleOp with minimal help (10 minutes)
- [ ] Explain sequential vs parallel with examples
- [ ] Add a new step to autonomous (5 minutes)
- [ ] Add a parallel action to autonomous (5 minutes)
- [ ] Test and debug their changes

**Team Success:**
- [ ] TeleOp works identically to before
- [ ] Autonomous can drive while intaking (couldn't before!)
- [ ] Students understand why the change was necessary
- [ ] Students can explain the new concepts to others

---

## Final Tips

1. **Go slow with Lesson 3** - Sequential vs Parallel is the most important concept
2. **Use lots of analogies** - Middle schoolers learn well from real-world examples
3. **Test frequently** - Build confidence by showing things work
4. **Celebrate wins** - "Look! The robot can drive AND intake at the same time now!"
5. **Keep it positive** - "This is an upgrade, not starting over"

**Remember:** The goal isn't to learn all of NextFTC - it's to migrate successfully with minimal confusion and maintain student confidence!

## Quick Reference: What Changed Summary

**Mechanism Files:**
- Add `extends Subsystem`
- Change `init()` to `initialize()`
- Lowercase method names

**TeleOp:**
- `extends NextFTCOpMode`
- Add `register(subsystem)`
- `loop()` becomes `run()`

**Autonomous:**
- `extends PedroOpMode`
- Use `SequentialGroup` for steps
- Use `ParallelGroup` for together
- Use `InstantCommand(() -> action)` for single actions

That's all students need to know!
