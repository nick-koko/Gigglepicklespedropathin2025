# Subsystem Conversion Summary

## What We've Created

You now have **three parallel work streams** ready for your students:

### 1️⃣ Autonomous Team (Independent Work)
**File:** `STUDENT_AUTONOMOUS_WORKSHEET.md` - **Print this out!**

**Task:** Convert `ExampleAuto.java` to use Sequential/Parallel groups

**What they'll do:**
- Break up the big path into smaller sections
- Add ParallelGroup and SequentialGroup
- Add `// TODO:` comments where mechanisms would run
- Add WaitCommand for delays

**What they need to know:**
- Sequential = do things in order
- Parallel = do things together
- FollowPathCommand = follow a path
- WaitCommand = wait for time

**They can work independently** because they're just planning structure with comments!

### 2️⃣ Intake Team (Needs Mentor Help)

**Files Created:**
- `subsystems/IntakeWithSensorsSubsystem.java` - The subsystem
- `examples/IntakeWithSensorsTest.java` - Test TeleOp

**What's different from TeleOpSensorTest.java:**
- ✅ Sensor logic moved into subsystem's `periodic()` method
- ✅ Automatic sensor checking every loop
- ✅ Simpler TeleOp code (70 lines vs 130+)
- ✅ Will work in autonomous automatically

**Key teaching points:**
1. **"The subsystem is smart!"**
   - Checks sensors automatically
   - Stops motors automatically
   - Tracks ball count internally

2. **"periodic() is magic!"**
   - Runs automatically every loop
   - Perfect for sensor monitoring
   - No manual calls needed

3. **"This works everywhere!"**
   - TeleOp: `intake.intakeForward()`
   - Autonomous: `new InstantCommand(() -> intake.intakeForward())`
   - Same sensor logic in both!

---

### 3️⃣ Shooter Team (Needs Mentor Help)

**Files Created:**
- `subsystems/ShooterSubsystem.java` - The subsystem
- `examples/ShooterTest.java` - Test TeleOp

**What's different from ShootingTest.java:**
- ✅ Velocity control in subsystem
- ✅ Simpler interface (spinUp/stop/setHighSpeed)
- ✅ Ready for PIDF enhancement later
- ✅ Easy to use in autonomous

**Key teaching points:**
1. **"Subsystem handles complexity!"**
   - Velocity calculations inside
   - Mode tracking inside
   - RPM conversions inside

2. **"Simple to use!"**
   - TeleOp: `shooter.spinUp()`, `shooter.stop()`
   - Autonomous: `new InstantCommand(() -> shooter.spinUp())`

3. **"Ready for upgrades!"**
   - Can add NextFTC PIDF later
   - TeleOp code stays the same
   - Just update the subsystem

## Teaching Strategy

### Phase 1: Kickoff (15 minutes - all together)
1. **Explain the three work streams**
   - "We're splitting up to work in parallel"
   - "Autonomous team can work independently"
   - "Intake/shooter teams will work with mentors"

2. **Show the end goal**
   - "All three will come together for full autonomous"
   - "Each piece is important"

3. **Assign teams**
   - Let students pick based on interest
   - Balance skill levels

### Phase 2: Parallel Work (1-2 hours)

**Autonomous Team (independent):**
- Give them printed worksheet
- Let them plan on paper first
- Check in every 20 minutes
- Help with syntax if needed

**Intake Team (with mentor):**
- Read through IntakeWithSensorsSubsystem together
- Find `periodic()` method - explain it runs every loop
- Deploy and test IntakeWithSensorsTest
- Compare to old TeleOpSensorTest
- Discuss: "Why is this better?"

**Shooter Team (with mentor):**
- Read through ShooterSubsystem together
- Find velocity control methods
- Deploy and test ShooterTest
- Compare to old ShootingTest
- Discuss: "How will we add PIDF later?"

### Phase 3: Integration (30 minutes - all together)
1. **Autonomous team presents their plan**
   - Show their Sequential/Parallel structure
   - Explain their `// TODO:` comments

2. **Intake team demonstrates**
   - Show subsystem working
   - Explain `periodic()` and sensors

3. **Shooter team demonstrates**
   - Show subsystem working
   - Explain velocity control

4. **Discuss next steps**
   - "How do we replace `// TODO:` with real commands?"
   - "What commands do we need to create?"

---

## Next Steps After Teams Complete

### 1. Replace TODO Comments
Autonomous team's comments become real commands:
```java
// OLD:
// TODO: Spin up shooter to 3000 RPM

// NEW:
new InstantCommand(() -> shooter.spinUp(3000, 900))
```

### 2. Create Complex Commands (if needed)
For actions that need to wait:
```java
public class SpinUpShooterCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public boolean isFinished() {
        return shooter.isAtTargetSpeed(50);
    }
}
```

### 3. Test Integration
- Test intake while following path
- Test shooter spin-up timing
- Tune wait times

### 4. Add PIDF to Shooter (future)
- Research NextFTC's PIDF controller
- Update ShooterSubsystem
- Test and tune

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Why can't intake team work independently?"**
A: They need to understand `periodic()` concept, which is new. Also need hardware to test sensors.

**Q: "Can we skip the subsystems and just use the old code?"**
A: You could, but then you lose:
- Automatic sensor checking
- Reusability in autonomous
- Clean separation of concerns
- Ability to add PIDF later

**Q: "How long will this take?"**
A: 
- Autonomous planning: 1-2 hours
- Intake subsystem: 1-2 hours (with testing)
- Shooter subsystem: 1-2 hours (with testing)
- Integration: 1 hour
- **Total: About one 3-4 hour meeting**

**Q: "What if we want to add more mechanisms later?"**
A: Just follow the same pattern:
1. Create MechanismSubsystem.java
2. Create test TeleOp
3. Test it works
4. Add to autonomous with InstantCommand

**Q: "Do we need command files for simple actions?"**
A: **NO!** Use `InstantCommand`:
```java
new InstantCommand(() -> intake.intakeForward())
```
Only create command files for complex logic (waiting for sensors, PIDF control, etc.)

## Tips for Mentors

### For Intake Team:
- **Focus on:** `periodic()` concept - this is the key insight
- **Show:** Compare line count (old vs new)
- **Emphasize:** "This will work in autonomous automatically!"

### For Shooter Team:
- **Focus on:** Subsystem encapsulation
- **Show:** How velocity control is hidden inside
- **Emphasize:** "Easy to upgrade to PIDF later!"

### For Both Mechanism Teams:
- **Compare:** Show old TeleOp side-by-side with new
- **Demonstrate:** Test on hardware to prove it works
- **Connect:** "This is the same as InstantCommand in autonomous"

## Remember

**The goal isn't perfection** - it's:
1. Understanding subsystem architecture
2. Seeing how NextFTC makes things easier
3. Building confidence for autonomous integration

**Students learn best by doing** - let them:
- Make mistakes
- Ask questions
- Test and iterate
- Figure things out together

**You're building foundation for success** - this structure will:
- Make autonomous much easier
- Allow easy PIDF upgrades
- Support future mechanism additions
- Reduce bugs and complexity

**Good luck! Your students are going to do great! 🤖**
